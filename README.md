# ChE 316 Chemical Engineering Fluid Mechanics

This repository is for my development of jupyter notebooks for the solution of chemical engineering fluid mechanics problems.

I am thankful to Dr. J. Kantor who has a similar approach and has published his content available at [jckantor.github.io/](https://jckantor.github.io/). I have used Dr. Kantor's site to learn many many things about how to integrate programming into teaching and learning.

## Google Colaboratory

I am using jupyter notebooks to develop python scripts to solve engineering problems. Access to jupyter notebooks can be through download/install from https://jupyter.org/, or through installation of a package manager such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). BUT, the easiest way to directly engage and get students direct access is through [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/). Open this in Google Chrome ... sign in with your Google account ... and you can create your first `New Notebook` right away and start coding without installing anything.

I have used colab.research.google.com to develop notebooks that I then upload to this GitHub repository.

## Viewing Jupyter Notebooks

I didn't have to enable a GitHub Pages site for the repository. Rather, for notebooks in the repository ... they can be viewed using [nbviewer.org](https://nbviewer.org) like this ...
