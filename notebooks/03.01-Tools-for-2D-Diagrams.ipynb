See https://www.drawio.com/doc/faq/math-typesetting for details on how this works. You can enable this in `draw.io` by going to `Extras` $\\rightarrow$ `Mathematical Typesetting`. If I highlight the content for Stream $\\boxed{3}$ in the example you can see the text that I actually entered to make this work.\n",
