**ChE 316 Chemical Engineering Fluid Mechanics** demonstrates the fluid mechanics principles applicable to chemical engineering practice with focus on the development of transport balances of mass, momentum and energy around control volumes for incompressible and compressible fluids.

The notebooks demonstrate these basic chemical engineering calculations using Python. The notebooks can be open
directly in Google Colaboratory where they can be run, edited, shared, and saved to your Google Drive. Alternatively, the notebooks can be downloaded and executed on your computer. These notebooks
were developed and tested using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution.

**Note on the use of Python.** The Python used in these notebooks is deliberately limited to a core set of language
features.  These notebooks use scalar variables and lists of scalar variables to represent data. Also used are
arithmetic, math, print, and plotting functions from the `matplotlib.pyplot` library. Functions created with `def`
and `lambda` are used when root-finding calculations are required. List comprehesions are used on occasion when the
result is more readable code. The `Sympy` library for symbolic math is used extensively for solving things like mass balances. Other libraries included `numpy`, `math`, and `scipy`. There are many helpful tools included with the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by [Jake Vanderplas](https://github.com/jakevdp).

**Google Colaboratory.** These suplementary materials use jupyter notebooks to develop python scripts to solve engineering problems. Access to jupyter notebooks can be through download/install from https://jupyter.org/, or through installation of a package manager such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). BUT, the easiest way to directly engage and for students to get direct access is through [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/). Open this in Google Chrome ... sign in with your Google account ... and you can create your first *New Notebook* right away and start coding without installing anything.
